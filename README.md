# Rockbuster Stealth Analysis â€“ Achievement 3

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my Data Analysis Bootcamp (Achievement 3) and involves analyzing customer and rental data for **Rockbuster Stealth LLC**, a fictional movie rental company. The business wants to compete with streaming giants like Netflix by using data to inform their global strategy.

I used **PostgreSQL** to clean and query the Rockbuster database and created a dashboard using **Tableau** to visualize key insights that support business decisions.
